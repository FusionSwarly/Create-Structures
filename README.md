Create: Structures is an add-on for Create that intends to further integrate the mod into vanilla by adding naturally generating structures.

These structures are built in the vanilla building style, while also utilizing blocks and items from the create mod. The structures only contain early game items and simple machinery as to not interfere with the mod's progression.

Currently, there are unique windmill structures added to the following villages:

    Plains Village
    Taiga Village
    Savanna Village
    Snowy Village

There is also a water mill structure in desert villages, and all structures spawn in zombie villages as well.
